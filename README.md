About The Project
This project was born from the idea of automating the tedious process of finding potential real estate investment opportunities. Instead of manually sifting through public records, this tool provides a clean, interactive dashboard to filter and analyze properties based on specific criteria. The main focus is on identifying homeowners who might be in a "troubled" situation (e.g., delinquent on taxes or their mortgage) and could be open to a quick sale.

This single-page application is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be lightweight, portable, and easy to modify without any complex setup.

Features
Dynamic Filtering: Filter properties by County, Minimum Delinquency amount, Maximum Price, Property Type, and number of Bedrooms.
Interactive Dashboard: At-a-glance summary statistics that update in real-time as you apply filters.
Data Visualization: Includes charts for visualizing market price trends and foreclosure activity over time. (Note: Chart display is currently being debugged).
Detailed Property View: Click on any property to see a detailed modal pop-up with a full breakdown of its financial and physical attributes.
CSV Data Export: Easily export your filtered list of properties into a .csv file for offline analysis or use in other programs.
Responsive Design: A clean and usable interface that adapts to both desktop and mobile screens.
